# Mario-using-Eye-gestures
Mario is a game where Mario jumps, runs, and passes obstacles across each level. If Mario touches an enemy, he dies. If he falls down a hole or misses a jump, he loses a life. Disabled people cannot play this game in such a fashion, as we need a keyboard to play the game. In this paper, I have proposed a way that can let users specifically people with disability to play games like Mario using eye gesture. The user will be able to play Mario by using their eyeball gestures. Instead of pressing the space bar key on the keyboard, the user will be able to jump by blinking their eye. Additionally, we can move Mario towards the right by moving the eyeballs towards the right instead of pressing the right arrow key on the keyboard. Similarly, we can move Mario towards the left by moving eyeballs towards the left, instead of pressing the left arrow key. The goal of my project is to make arcade games like Mario accessible to disabled people.
